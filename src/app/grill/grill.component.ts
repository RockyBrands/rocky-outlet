It will make you wish you had a cold beer on a Friday night! It will also make your pants fit not quite right, but we don't have to think about that.";

//then we add the 1/3lb. non-GMO burger patty from Symmes Creek Ranch in Patriot Ohio, seasoned with a house blend of spices. We top that tasty boi with bacon, cheddar cheese, our house made Bubba's Kickin' Q sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion. Add your favorite side or stick with the delicious salty crunch of Connâ€™s Potato chips, and it is a meal not soon to be forgotten!
